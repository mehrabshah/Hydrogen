## Setup for using Customer Account API (`/account` section)

### Setup public domain using ngrok

1. Setup a [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account and add a permanent domain (ie. `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.app`).
1. Install the [ngrok CLI](https://ngrok.com/download) to use in terminal
1. Start ngrok using `ngrok http --domain=<your-ngrok-domain>.app 3000`

### Include public domain in Customer Account API settings

1. Go to your Shopify admin => `Hydrogen` or `Headless` app/channel => Customer Account API => Application setup
1. Edit `Callback URI(s)` to include `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.app/account/authorize`
1. Edit `Javascript origin(s)` to include your public domain `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.app` or keep it blank
1. Edit `Logout URI` to include your public domain `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.app` or keep it blank

### Prepare Environment variables

Run [`npx shopify hydrogen link`](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/cli#link) or [`npx shopify hydrogen env pull`](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/cli#env-pull) to link this app to your own test shop.

Alternatly, the values of the required environment varaibles "PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_CLIENT_ID" and "PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_URL" can be found in customer account api settings in the Hydrogen admin channel.
